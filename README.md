Hi, I am Traslox.

Hallo, Ich heiße Traslox.

Merhaba, ben Traslox.

I know enough English to communicate. I am new to german but I still learning.
I'm trying to still alive in Erdogan's Turkey. I corrupted my mental health (It's just joke).
Microsoft Edge steals my ideas on my projects, It would be easier if they just asked me.
But despite all this, I'm still ok.
